This file gives direction to our design report and self-defined test cases.

The design report file is called design_report.md.
The new test cases are in main.cpp. Methods test4(), test5(), and test6() are developed with the following objectives:
    1. Tests whether the B+ Tree index can correctly handle a large amount of insertions with negative keys.
    2. Tests whether the scanner of B+ Tree index can handle edge cases (e.g. only scan for the key at the end).
