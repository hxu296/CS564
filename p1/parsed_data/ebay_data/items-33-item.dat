Imported cotton/spandex.(b21p17e) ** Catalog Price: $48 Size: 4 Color: Black (Shown in Khanki) Flaws: None Ho, Ho, HO, Merry Christmas!! We would like to show our Christmas spirit as well as our gratitude to all of our wonderful Ebay customers for the holidays. Our Christmas special allows all Ebayers to purchase one item at their winning bid amount (plus $5.50 for shipping & handling) and get a second item (of equal or lesser value) for 50% off your winning bid amount PLUS we will waive the additional item shipping charge! This is good for all auctions that are marked _Christmas Special_. You can only use this special with one transaction at a time. Example: If you purchase 4 items and wish to have them all shipped together you can only use the special for 2 items and will be charged the winning bid amount plus $1 s&h for the additional two items. Or, you can use the special for the 4 items separately. You can use the special on the first two items and pay $5.50 for s&h, and then use the special for the second two items and pay $5.50 for s&h. In some instances this would not work out as well for you as using the combined shipping option. We wish everyone the VERY Merriest Christmas And Happy New Year!! Note: All of our merchandise is customer returns and/or overstock in excellent condition. If there are any flaws such as rips, holes, and tears we will make sure to describe the flaw in the description of the item. Some of the merchandise may need to be washed or cleaned but not necessarily flawed. Some of the tags have been cut by Victoria's Secret but sizes and manufacturer tags still remain in most. We don't accept returns on this item so please email if you have specific questions before bidding. Shipping and handling is $5.50 for your first item and if combined with other items $1 for each additional item. Thank you so much for looking!!! Thank you for looking at my auction!!

I do recheck measurements by measuring straight across the waist of jeans and then doubled. I do not give returns on sizing. I will furnish you with a picture to resell them on ebay if you don't like them or they don't fit. I take money orders OR paypal, NO CHECKS. Buyers feel free to use the instant purchase logo from Paypal on this site. You don't even have to wait until notification. If you win more than one item pay only once through paypal since they charge a fee for each transaction. 6.50 for shipping/handling priority mail.

If you are outside the USA, please contact me before bidding. _ ****See my other Auction items**** This applies to items shipped First Class Only!! Note: As a seller it's sometimes hard to determine the exact shipping price on an item. Sometimes it might cost less then what I anticipate, and sometimes more. If it costs more, I pay the difference, but then again, if it costs a little less, I do not make refunds. I think that's fair. I charge only $2.50 for shipping because I ship First Class in a yellow envelope. The item is wrapped in tissue paper, then placed in a large zip lock bag so that in case it rains it will hopefully not get wet. I haven't had any problems so far, but I will ship priority if you desire. The price for shipping (and handling) priority is $4.00 on one item (more for multiple). I am also not responsible for lost or damaged items. If you are the high bidder and you'd like your item insured, please advise me before payment is submitted. Please disregard the ebay checkout method. You will receive a confirmation from me via paypal. All Items are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. God Bless America and your family!"

First is a darling little pink hooded sweatshirt with Minnie Mouse in a heart on the front, and mouse ears on the black hood; brand name ""Disney Babies,"" made by Walt Disney Co. It is made of 100% acrylic, and the tag shows it is for infants 16 1/2 to 20 pounds. The paint on Minnie's face is beginning to show a little bit of wear, but the construction of the sweatshirt is in excellent condition. Next we have a long-sleeve sweatshirt that is light yellow in color with assorted flowers all over it; brand name ""Garanimals"". It has a yellow scalloped band on the neckline and solid yellow edging on the sleeves and the bottom. It is made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The front of the shirt does have some spots on it, and I am not sure if they will come out in the wash or not. The last item is a pair of 100% cotton bib overalls by McKids (with the golden arches) from the McDonald's Corp. They are a light green corduroy with red and purple flowers all over them. The area on the sides at the waist have elastic for a comfortable fit and they have a snap crotch for easy diaper changing. They have been worn, but they are in extremely good condition.

A cruel but funny joke. Each ""parking ticket"" carries a ""$100 FINE."" Just imagine the fun you're going to have with these. Imagine how YOU would react to see one on your car. The blaze orange color make them easily noticeable from a long distance away. These tickets are professionally printed on quality stock and look like the real thing. Unfortunately the poor photos do not show the actual quality of these tickets. They are very convincing until the recipient starts to read the fine print. These tickets sell for as much as $2.00 or $3.00 each in specialty shops. The fine print says: ""This notice may be returned by mail, carrier pigeon, personally, or by an authorized employee of the Tooth Fairy. A hearing at the North Pole may be obtained upon written request of the registered owner. Failure to obey this notice within ten seconds after the date of this violation may result in the non-renewal of the license to drive & the registration by of the registered owner. This notice may be appealed (yea, right) and adjusted by mail if supporting statement(s) & any unnecessary documentation is mailed within ten seconds after the date of violation. If registered owner is not laughing uncontrollably with ten seconds of receiving this ticket, the fine is increased to $200.00 - Failure of the lessee of taxis or leased vehicles to obey parking violation notices issued by the Tooth Fairy during their lease may result in a warped sense of humor & the desire to play pranks on their family and friends. - FAILURE TO PAY PARKING FINES MAY SUBJECT MOTOR VEHICLE OWNER TO FITS OF LAUGHTER.

We would like to show our Christmas spirit as well as our gratitude to all of our wonderful Ebay customers for the holidays. Our Christmas special allows all Ebayers to purchase one item at their winning bid amount (plus $5.50 for shipping & handling) and get a second item (of equal or lesser value) for 50% off your winning bid amount PLUS we will waive the additional item shipping charge! This is good for all auctions that are marked _Christmas Special_. You can only use this special with one transaction at a time. Example: If you purchase 4 items and wish to have them all shipped together you can only use the special for 2 items and will be charged the winning bid amount plus $1 s&h for the additional two items. Or, you can use the special for the 4 items separately. You can use the special on the first two items and pay $5.50 for s&h, and then use the special for the second two items and pay $5.50 for s&h. In some instances this would not work out as well for you as using the combined shipping option. We wish everyone the VERY Merriest Christmas And Happy New Year!!

If there are any flaws such as rips, holes, and tears we will make sure to describe the flaw in the description of the item.
