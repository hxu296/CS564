Certainly the booze-oriented, birds-obsessed antics of Martin Clunes' Gary and Neil Morrissey's Tony have become every bit as connected to Britain's collective funny bone as Basil Fawlty's inept hostelry or Ernie Wise's short, hairy legs. Yet, the series could easily have been cancelled when ITV viewers failed to respond to the original version, which featured Clunes sharing his flat with someone named Dermot, played by Harry Enfield. Indeed, it was only when the third series moved to the BBC and was then broadcast in a post-watershed slot--allowing writer Simon Nye greater freedom to explore his characters' saucier ruminations--that the show began to gain a significant audience. By then, of course, Morrissey had become firmly ensconced on the collective pizza-stained sofa, while more screen time was allocated to the boys' respective foils, Caroline Quentin and Leslie Ash. Often glibly dismissed as a lame-brained succession of gags about sex and flatulence, the later series not only featured great performances and sharp-as-nails writing but also sported a contemporary attitude that dared to go where angels, and certainly most other sitcoms, feared to tread. Or, as Gary was once moved to comment about soft-porn lesbian epic Love in a Women's Prison: ""It's a serious study of repressed sexuality in a pressure-cooker environment."" Series 5 includes: ""Hair"" in which Tony returns from holiday to discover Dorothy has convinced Gary she should move in. And that Tony should move out; ""The Good Pub Guide"" in which our heroes are dismayed when The Crown gets a new look and new landlord (The Fast Show's John Thomson). Tony rescues the pub's old condom machine as a present for Deborah (""I thought it was something we could enjoy together.""); ""Cowardice"" in which Tony becomes convinced Deborah is going through a lesbian phase; ""Your Mate Vs Your Bird"" in which increased tension in the household persuades Dorothy to reconsider her living arrangements; ""Cardigan"" in which Gary, concerned he's becoming middle-aged, suggests they go to a rave; ""Rich and Fat"" in which Tony goes on a diet after Gary accuses him of being ""a bit of a podgemeister""; ""Home Made Sauna"" in which temptation comes Gary's way when Dorothy and Deborah go away for a sailing weekend. Duration: 203 mins The video is in excellent condition and comes in a plastic case with all original artwork and description. It is in US video format, playable on US VCRs.

But with her loveliness and genius went an enigmatic contradiction of character that could lead only to tragedy. Olga Spessivtzeva's mental collapse in 1940 was followed by her detention for twenty-two years in the Hudson River State Hospital, New York, almost f_rgotten by the world and those who had hailed her as the successor t_ Pavlova. To a great extent those lost years must remain unwritten, but Anton Dolin, who as an unknown youth first saw Spessivtzeva from the wings, paints a very moving picture of her development as a dancer, her triumphs throughout the world and her relationship with such giants of the ballet world as Fokine, Lifar and Lopoukhova, as well as himself. In unfolding the story of this great Russian star he also makes many be]_i -the-scenes revelations and recritates some of the finest ballet of our time. Ma nificently illustrated, ~~ 9 The Sleeping Ballerina is a book to enrapture anyone with an interest in the arts. THE AUTHOR Anton Dolin needs no introduction as one of the world's finest ballet dancers. The only British male dancer to star with Diaghilev's Russian Ballet, for whom he created many leading r_les, he was principal dancer with the VicWells Company from 1931-35 and founded London's Festival Ballet in 1949, guiding it for twelve years. The author of several books, including a biography of Alicia Markova, he now devotes himself to choreography, which enables him to combine his favourite recreation, travel. i. ///////////////////// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Hello and welcome : I try to always list similar items or collections at the same time so check my other auctions for possibly more items like this one !

A little cheesier than the first two Jurassic blockbusters, it's a big B movie with big B-list stars (including Laura Dern, briefly reprising her Jurassic Park role), and eight years of advancing computer-generated-image technology give it a sharp edge over its predecessors. While adopting the jungle spirit of King Kong, the movie refines Michael Crichton's original premise, and its dinosaurs are even more realistic, their behavior more detailed, and their variety--including flying pteranodons and a new villain, the spinosaurus--more dazzling and threatening than ever. These advancements justify the sequel, and its contrived plot is just clever enough to span 90 minutes without wearing out its welcome. Posing as wealthy tourists, an adventurous couple (William H. Macy, T_a Leoni) convince paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his prot_g_ (Allesandro Nivola) to act as tour guides on a flyover trip to Isla Sorna, the ill-fated ""Site B"" where all hell broke loose in The Lost World: Jurassic Park. In truth, they're on a search-and-rescue mission to find their missing son (Trevor Morgan), and their plane crash is just the first of several enjoyably suspenseful sequences. Director Joe Johnston (October Sky) embraces the formulaic plot as a series of atmospheric set pieces, placing new and familiar dinosaurs in misty rainforests, fiery lakes, and mysterious valleys, turning JP3 into a thrill ride with impressive highlights (including a T. rex versus spinosaurus smack-down), adequate doses of wry humor (from the cowriters of Election), and an upbeat ending that's corny but appropriate, proving that the symptoms of sequelitis needn't be fatal. *DTS Surround Sound, Dolby Digital *PAL Formatted (not NTSC) *Subtitles: English, Malay, Chinese & Thai WInner please add $4.50 S&H. Personal checks, money order & paypal are accepted. Good Luck!!!"

Please note: Due to the size of the item, I had to make two scans and then ""stitch"" the scans so the entire thing would show. However, stitching causes a horizontal line; this is the fault of the scanner and not that of the photo. Also, since the scan wasn't perfectly lined up, the black dress may appear slightly lighter in color than the rest. Cast your eyes upon the darkest black of the dress and THAT is what this ad looks like. Finally, the background didn't scan well, I probably used the wrong resolution. The ad is huge and beautiful and in EXCELLENT condition; I know of those who would call this ""mint."" Check out the expression on Bette's face! Dimensions: 9.75"" x 13 1/4.""

Her composition teachers in Israel and in the U.S. have included A.U. Boskovich, Paul Ben-Haim, Norman Dello Joio and Ralph Shapey. Her principal piano teachers were Nadia Reisenberg and Dorothy Taubman. Among her numerous awards, fellowships and commissions are those from the Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund, the Ford Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Fromm Music Foundation, WFMT, Chamber Music America, Eastman School of Music, the American Composers Orchestra (Concerto for Orchestra), the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center (Concerto da Camera II), the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, the Philadelphia Orchestra (Symphony, first performed in 1990, Pulitzer Prize 1991, first place Kennedy Center Friedheim Award, 1992), the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (Legends), the Baltimore Symphony (Vessels of Courage and Hope), the Koussevitzky Music Foundation, and many more. Her first opera, Between Two Worlds (The Dybbuk), which received its much-acclaimed premiere in June, 1997, was commissioned by the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and was described in Opera News as ""the most powerful new music-theater piece to emerge from Lyric_s composer-in-residence program."" The European premiere of Between Two Worlds took place in May, 1999, at the Bielefeld Opera, in a German translation. Ms. Ran_s Hyperbolae for piano won the competition for a set piece for all participants in the Second Artur Rubinstein International Piano Competition in Israel in 1977. Her East Wind for solo flute was commissioned by the National Flute Association for its 1988 Young Artists Competition. She is presently working on a new work for flute and orchestra, commissioned by the National Flute Association for the organization_s year 2000 convention, and on a concerto for viola for the German violist Tabea Zimmermann. We can look forward to future compositions from this highly respected composer to have the same emotional quality and technical superiority that has led critics to acclaim her work as ""written with the same sense of humanity found in Mozart_s most profound opera arias or Mahler's searching symphonies."" In 1990, Ms. Ran was appointed by Maestro Daniel Barenboim to be Composer-in-Residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as part of the Meet the Composer Orchestra Residencies Program, a position she held for seven seasons. From 1994 to 1997, Ran also served as the fifth Brena and Lee Freeman Sr. Composer-in-Residence with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Shulamit Ran, who had performed extensively as a pianist in the U.S., Europe, Israel and elsewhere, is presently the William H. Colvin Professor in the Department of Music at the University of Chicago, where she has taught since 1973. In 1987 she was Visiting Professor at Princeton University. She is the recipient of honorary doctorates from Mount Holyoke College (1988), Spertus Institute (1994), Beloit College (1996), and the New School of Social Research in New York (1997), and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. Her works are published by the Theodore Presser Company and by the Israeli Music Institute. Recordings are available on Bridge, CRI, Erato, JMC (Jerusalem Music Center), Koch International Classics and Vox labels, including several all-Ran discs, with recording projects with Teldec (Chicago Symphony Orchestra), New World Records (Peabody Trio), and Gasparo (clarinetist Arthur Campbell) still ahead. http://www.presser.com/ran.html This is a new unsealed CD on Bridge issued in 1995 with TT of 57.28.

You are bidding on: The original vhs tapes The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, starring Rock Hudson, Roddy McDowall, Darren McGavin, Bernadette Peters! Vol. 1 - The Expedition Vol. 2 - The Settlers Vol. 3 - The Martians. They play GREAT! They come in BRAND NEW clamshell cases (original cases cut to fit these new cases). Some sun fading. Earth sends its first manned probe to Mars in 1999, and a jealous Martian murders the two astronauts when his wife has erotic dreams of meeting them. Members of a subsequent expedition are hypnotized into believing that they have landed in the childhood community of their leader and have been reunited with deceased family and friends, and they are poisoned by the Martians. Col. John Wilder leads a third expedition and learns that a chicken pox virus brought to Mars by the first two expeditions has almost eradicated the Martian population. A member of Wilder's team becomes obsessed with protecting Mars from Earthman and murders some of the others in Wilder's party, before Wilder kills him. Colonists arrive on Mars to settle, among them priests seeking God, and a lone Martian masquerades as the most desired persons of various settlers. Global war on Earth reduces man's natal planet to radioactive waste, and most of the settlers returned there prior to the holocaust. Wilder struggles to assemble the remaining humans on Mars, who cope with their loneliness in different ways and will not leave their piece of Mars, before Wilder meets a Martian of past or future who tells him the secret of simple Martian life and convinces him to abandon the Earth lifestyle.

And indeed, it is diverting to spend some time watching his disturbingly dark images, replete with bloody violence, sex, nudity, urban crime, corruption, conspiracy, and the intense torment of its antihero, Spawn. This collection contains four DVDs, one for each of the three seasons of Spawn as seen on HBO, plus a supplement disc. The first season establishes the premise and the characters. Government assassin Al Simmons is betrayed and brutally killed by corrupt elements within his own agency. Damned by his past, he's cast into Hell, where he bargains his services to lead the apocalypse in exchange for returning to Earth to be near his wife. But Spawn cannot resume their relationship; he was returned five years after his death and she's remarried - to his best friend. This fuels a seemingly unquenchable rage. But the underlying conflict is whether Spawn can reclaim his humanity and ultimately save himself. As he's driven to further violence, his salvation eludes him. Ultimately, he does regain enough self-control to rebel against the powers of evil and he becomes a free agent, left to battle his own internal demons while external demons taunt him. Spawn 2 continues this saga on the second DVD. Spawn/Simmons discovers who killed him and while confronting the assassin, learns whom in the agency ordered his destruction, Jason Wynn. Spawn is desperate to understand his past, and he struggles to regain the memories stolen from him. Spawn learns the real truth about his friend's apparent betrayal of marrying his widowed wife. A strange benefactor, revealed to have fought his way back from the damned, tries to guide Spawn. He warns Spawn that his only hope is to avoid the violence that harvests evil souls for the demon world. But Spawn is torn between a longing to regain his soul and his passion for revenge. The third HBO season is on DVD three. Spawn finds himself pursued by the police, Wynn and his minions, and assassins from Heaven. It seems that the competition for souls is getting serious and both sides are now playing hard ball. Spawn continues to battle his internal demons, and begins to reveal a long-suppressed nobility. But the forces of evil continue to manipulate his fate. He's tricked into fulfilling an ancient prophecy that may lead to the destruction of all mankind. We learn more about his earthly spirit guide, Cogliostro, and as we do, we come to understand that if Spawn can overcome his rage and once again trust another, he may be able to save himself. This becomes most difficult as a corrupt officer controlled by the sociopath Wynn frames him for a brutal attack on a policeman. As domestic animation goes, the production values are high. The voice actors are effective and feature a few surprising guest stars. The adult themes are thought provoking. As McFarlane explains during his interview, the quality of the animation hovers between Disney theatrical and children's Saturday morning. Be warned: these unrated films are not for children. The Spawn series is graphically violent and somewhat explicit, although there's less sexual content in seasons two and three than in the first, when McFarlane was trying to capture his audience. Video The DVD is presented in its original aspect ratio for television, 4:3 full frame. Digital artifacts are not an issue; the video is consistently excellent with great dynamic range, no noise, and nicely saturated color. Audio The sound is Dolby Digital 4.0 (the rear channels are mono) derived from the original Dolby Surround. Surround information is present, but modest. Score, sound effects, and dialog are consistently clear. The sound improves with each succeeding season. The bandwidth becomes more extended and more low frequency effects are present. The voice actors, looped in the studio, are predominantly recorded very dryly. So with a fine audio system, the voices sound like they could be in the room with you. Supplements Each of the discs has some features in common. Both English and Spanish spoken languages are available, as are English, Spanish, and French subtitles. There are several pages of Todd McFarlane biographical material. And there is an interview with Todd McFarlane which both immediately follows the closing credits and is available from the Special Features menu. Each film offers screen-specific screen-specific audio commentary by McFarlane. In addition, the first disc contains some narrated storyboards and a full-frame trailer for the live action Spawn movie presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and with a higher fidelity than any of the animated films. The third disc contains a behind-the-scenes Featurette with Todd McFarlane in which he discusses the evolution of the character and some differences among the animated series, the live action series, and the comic books. There are also some screens that describe the nature of the characters, and two music videos. The fourth DVD contains supplemental material that complements the extras found on the other three DVDs. There are three storyboards shown simultaneously with the completed animation. There are two ""interviews"" with Todd McFarlane. The sheer amount of material in this set is daunting. It will take you over eight hours to get through the films and the supplements. If you want to listen to McFarlane's full-length commentaries, be prepared to spend over seven additional hours. Payment can be made in $US, Australian dollars, or French Francs. Winning bidder to add $4.50 for priority shipping in the US. International will be more. Insurance if requested by winning bidder will be extra. Please email if you have further questions. Thank you very much!"

Edition Details:What would you get if you combined the BBC, six Victorian novels, and a cheesy 1970s soap opera? Well, this! The Pallisers is as lavish in its aristocratic intrigues (political scandal and opportunity, lecherous dukes, palatial country houses, a world where everyone knows their place) as it is in its soap opera aesthetic (characters' tumultuous struggles for power, money, love). This made-for-television production is a strange blend of exquisite costuming, remarkable sets, and surprisingly good acting on the one hand and video-quality production and an utterly melodramatic script on the other. Definitely pleasurable viewing for all who enjoy watching the period passion, pomp, and politics of upper-class Victorians. Set 1 contains the first 8 episodes of the BBC's 26-episode serialization of Anthony Trollope's Palliser novels (1865-1880), introducing Plantagenet Palliser and Lady Glencora, whose politically expedient marriage sets the stage for the rest of the Palliser dynasty's saga. The DVD's special features include a 36-page viewer's guide, an interview with Susan Hampshire (Lady Glencora), and information on Anthony Trollope, his fiction, and the Trollope Society. Edition Details: Color, Box set 4-disc Box Set Payment and Shipping IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE WINNING BIDDER! Please DO NOT send payment before reading!

Please see the scans below for an idea. When movies are released theatrically in Japan, souvenir programs are sold at the theater. The programs are like magazines which feature color pictures as well as b&w photos, and lots of accompanying text (mostly in Japanese). What makes these programs so unique is that they feature a lot of pics (from the film as well as publicity shots) that aren't commonly available. Movie programs are a big collectible in Japan, and for good reason: they're QUALITY mementos of your favorite films. They go for big bucks over there, but there is NO RESERVE on this auction! Please see our other auctions for more programs of classic films. Winners of multiple program auctions save a ton on shipping (just one shipping charge) and receive a 5% discount off their entire order!

Starring Klaus Kinski. Rated R. Graphic violence and nudity. Special features include interactive menus, scene index, and quiz. One of the better efforts from prolific cult director Jesus Franco, this Swiss-German horror film stars Klaus Kinski, in his final film for Franco, as the notorious Jack The Ripper. A respected doctor by day, Kinski bloodily dismembers London prostitutes bynight, until the local inspector's girlfriend (Josephine Chaplin) goes undercover to catch him. Full of graphic gore and nudity, the film is likely to appeal to horror buffs more than Kinski's usual fanbase, but his is a mesmerizing and quite effective performance. Herbert Fuchs and Lina Romay are among the Franco regulars in the cast, with Fuchs turning in an amusing cameo as a would-be extortionist. U.S. shipping and handling is $3.00.

YOU ARE BIDDING ON THIS AWESOME MOVIE POSTER WHICH IS THE US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER AND IS IN MINT CONDITION, NEVER USED WITH SHARP EDGES AND CORNERS AND COMES ROLLED, PROTECTIVELY WRAPPED IN PLASTIC, CUSHIONED AND SECURED AND SHIPPED IN A PROTECTIVE TUBE (WE HAVE OVER 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS SO BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!!). POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE US ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 27x40 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for RETURN OF THE JEDI posters sell for about $100 each (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like RETURN OF THE JEDI. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint. Those are photocopies of the originals and the quality is not nearly as good. I offer a complete satisfaction guarantee on all my products!!!

Macy, Craig T. Nelson, Bill Cobbs Director: Rob Reiner Categories: Drama, Historical Film Rated: PG13 (Adult Situations ) Running Time: 130 minutes _ _ SYNOPSIS _ _ This is a long-awaited film telling the story of the trials of Medgar Evers' killer. Medger Evers (James Pickens, Jr.) was a black civil-rights activist in Mississippi who was shot to death in 1963. Despite very persuasive evidence that Byron De La Beckwith (James Woods) was indeed his killer, the all-white juries hearing his case at that time acquitted him (he was tried twice). In this film, with the aid of Ever's widow Myrlie (Whoopie Goldberg), Bobby DeLaughter (Alec Baldwin), a young lawyer, gathers enough new evidence to bring Beckwith in for a third trial. Woods' performance as a wise-cracking bigot is one of the film's highlights. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide _ _ _ Buy now and get your Items by Christmas.... *** TERMS*** *Please direct all questions to smrtdsgn1@aol.com *Shipping is set at $5.00 and I'm sorry but I am unable to give multiple item shipping discounts at this time._ All the movies are shipped via U.S.P.S.

I never deal in Bootlegs or Screeners! NTSC format for USA and Canada. You are PRE-ORDERING this auction. The release date is JANUARY 8TH 2002 and will be shipped as early as JANUARY 4TH 2002. The second most-watched miniseries (after Roots) of all time, The Thorn Birds was originally broadcast in 1983 and captivated viewers with its story of a lifelong conflict between the spirit and the flesh. Adapted from the bestselling novel by Colleen McCullough, the production stars Richard Chamberlain as a Catholic priest named Ralph de Bricassart, whose life in Australia between 1920 and 1962 is one long torment as he pines for his lover, Meggie Carson (Rachel Ward), while seeking advancement in his clergyman career. The passion and the guilt make for compelling drama, but a stellar cast of supporting players adds muscle to the proceedings: Barbara Stanwyck (who won an Emmy for her work as Meggie's tough grandmother), Jean Simmons, Richard Kiley, Christopher Plummer, Bryan Brown, and Mare Winningham. Chamberlain, who was something of the king of the miniseries form at the time, is very good in the lead, as is the often-underrated Ward. Their affair is indeed irresistible to watch, which proves to be true, too, of the story's thick weave of church politics, forbidden desire, social change over decades, and family secrets.

Brand New and still factory sealed Director Billy Wilder Genre Comedy Released 1959 Length 120 Code All Code (compatible with all DVD player) Language English Subtitle Eng / Indo / Chi / On-Off Format Full Screen B&W Sound Dolby Digital The launching pad for Billy Wilder 's comedy classic was a rusty old German farce, Fanfares of Love , whose two main characters were male musicians so desperate to get a job that they disguise themselves as women and play with an all-girl band in gangster-dominated 1929 Chicago. In this version, musicians Joe ( Tony Curtis ) and Jerry ( Jack Lemmon ) lose their jobs when a speakeasy owned by mob boss Spats Columbo ( George Raft ) is raided by prohibition agent Mulligan ( Pat O'Brien ). Several weeks later, on February 14th, Joe and Jerry get a job perfroming in Urbana and end up witnessing a gangland massacre in a parking garage. Fearing that they will be next on the mobsters' hit lists, Joe devises an ingenious plan for disguising their identities. Soon they are all dolled up and performing as Josephine and Daphne in Sweet Sue's all-girl orchestra. En route to Florida by train with Sweet Sue's band, the boys (girls?) make the acquaintance of Sue's lead singer Sugar Kane ( Marilyn Monroe , in what may be her best performance). Joe and Jerry immediately fall in love, though of course their new feminine identities prevent them from acting on their desires. Still, they are determined to woo her, and they enact an elaborate series of gender-bending ruses complicated by the fact that flirtatious millionaire Osgood Fielding ( Joe E. Brown ) has fallen in love with ""Daphne."" The plot gets even thicker when Spats Columbo and his boys show up in Florida. Nominated for several Oscars, Some Like It Hot ended up the biggest moneymaking comedy up to 1959. Full of hilarious set pieces and movie in-jokes, it has not tarnished with time and in fact seems to get better with each passing year, as its cross-dressing humor keeps it only more and more up-to-date. ========================================================================= Postage Winning bidder to pay $5.00 for shipping.

This is a VHS movie. Written by: Jules Feiffer Starring: Jack Nicholson Candice Bergen All Skinnyguy movies are quality guaranteed. Director Mike Nichols's provocative film, based on a Jules Feiffer script about the changes in America's sexual mores over the course of the three decades, chronicles the bitter experiences of two middle-class American males. Jonathan (Jack Nicholson), a cruel but charismatic misogynist, and Sandy (Art Garfunkel), a bland idealist, meet as roommates at a small New England college in the 1940s. As their friendship progresses through the following decades, their search for the ideal woman leads to failed marriages, bad relationships, and emotional emptiness. Nichols is particularly adept at negotiating the kind of psychological minefield presented in CARNAL KNOWLEDGE. Nicholson is fascinating to watch, but the supporting women, including Candice Bergen and Ann-Margret, supply the soul. Nichols uses a shadowy film noir technique that underscores the movie's exploration of the uncertainty in relationships and also employs long close-ups that offer the characters no roo! m ! to prevaricate in his bleak vision of men, women, and romance.

Because it means you don't have to monitor the auction as it unfolds. You also don't have to worry about being outbid at the very last minute unless someone bids over your maximum dollar amount. Want more details? Check out an example of proxy bidding . _ Choose your maximum carefully , though, as you won't be able to reduce it later. Your bid is a contract _ Only place a bid if you're serious about buying the item; if you're the winning bidder, you will enter into a legally binding contract to purchase the item from the seller."

While garbed in her skimpy mermaid costume, she has a run-in with handsome space technician Bruce Templeton (Rod Taylor). Through a series of misunderstandings, Bruce is led to believe that Jennifer is an enemy spy, determined to steal scientific secrets. Several other characters enter into the plot, including bumbling secret agent Julius Pritter (Dom DeLuise) and prissy security chief Homer Cripps (Paul Lynde). Also on hand are TV favorites Dick Martin as Jennifer's erstwhile beau and Eric Fleming as a man of mystery. A few cute celebrity cameos round out this ribtickler, while Doris Day, as always, gets a few opportunities to sing. DELUXE LETTER-BOX EDITION. Color/1 hour 50 minutes.

Parkes Producer Ed Solomon Screenwriter Mary E. Vogt Costume Designer Donald Peterman Director of Photography Bo Welch Production Designer Jim Miller Editor Synopsis: A hilariously stoic top-secret federal agent (Tommy Lee Jones) and his wisecracking partner (Will Smith) don their matching Ray-Bans and skinny black ties and proceed to use all their considerable weaponry and wit to save the world from an undocumented and extremely unfriendly mantislike alien. MEN IN BLACK is a successful, tongue-in-cheek spoof of summer blockbuster alien invasion flicks, based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham. Description: In the 1950s a super-secret government agency was formed to monitor and police the activities of extraterrestrial aliens on the planet Earth. Some 40 years later a founding father of the agency, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), finds himself with a new smart-mouthed partner fresh from the NYPD who is soon dubbed Agent Jay (Will Smith). Their first mission is to save the Earth from destruction by a giant insectlike alien (Vincent D__Onfrio) that, incidentally, drives an exterminator__s truck. Armed with their matching Ray-Bans, skinny ties, and space-age weapons that Jay barely understands--he calls the Neuralyzer the ""flashy thing""--the new duo begin another average day of fighting intergalactic terrorists. An amazingly hip and terribly clever movie that riffs on everything from E.T.--THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL to CASABLANCA, this Barry Sonnenfeld film is based on the equally savvy comic book by Lowell Cunningham.

Swedish title: Smultronstallet, theatrical release in 1957 Winner of Berlin International Film Festival in 1958 Starring Victor Sjostrom, Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, Gunnar Bjornstrand. Directed by Ingmar Bergman. Movie Spec: B&W, Dolby Digital. 91 Minutes ***FULL SCREEN*** -- Smultronstallet/Wild Strawberries is one of the masterpieces of world cinema, a key early representative of the European art films that would change how people thought about movies in the late 1950s and 1960s. While the film posits a frightening questioning of life, it ultimately offers hope and redemption to its dying protagonist, and ultimately to us all. Director Ingmar Bergman effectively alternates emotional warmth with coldness to create one of the screen's greatest philosophical character studies. His shot composition is remarkable, particularly his close-ups of legendary Swedish director Victor Sjostrom, here playing the dying professor. The film is full of masterful symbolic imagery and allegorical storytelling. Most important, Bergman makes his film accessible to the ordinary viewer. This is a warm and human film, strongly filled with a richness rarely experienced on screen. - Richard Gilliam You Playable in region 1 (USA/Canada) DVD player Original Swedish language Removable Chinese subtitles and unremovable English subtitles _Brand New and Factory Sealed!

All code region 0 NTSC DVD playable on any DVD players Director: Francesco Rosi Cast : John Turturro, Rade Serbedzija, Massimo Ghini, Stefano Dionisi, Teco Celio, Roberto Citran, Claudio Bisio Dolby Digital Sound / Letter Box / In Original English with Chinese Subtitles / 117 mins The Odyssey of an Italian Jew from Auschwitz to his Home This film had won the Audience Award Best Feature of 1997 Sao Paulo International Film Festival, Best Director, Best Film and Best Producer of 1997 David di Donatello Awards. Italian chemist turned author Primo Levi was interred at Auschwitz during WW II until 1945. Following his release, he returned to his native Turin and penned the wrenching autobiographical account of life in the concentration camp If This Is a Man. In 1962, he wrote a companion book, The Truce, a chronicle of his hellish nine-month journey from the camp to Turin. Both books are crucial entries in the history of the Holocaust. This careful adaptation of the second book took filmmaker Francesco Rosi 10 years to make. Levi's trek begins when shortly after the Germans leave, four Russian horsemen ride up and tear down the gates of Auschwitz. Levi is quickly aboard one of the first outbound trucks. Over the next few months, he goes to many different countries, and along the way he meets and is befriended by assorted fellow travelers. Through them, his appreciation of life and freedom slowly returns, but with it also comes a deep rage and an abiding guilt at having survived, a guilt that may have led Levi to suicide in 1987.

The dvd is new & is factory sealed. Special features include interactive menus, scene index, and quiz. PRELUDE TO WAR was the first entry in the U.S. WAR DEPARTMENT'S WHY WE FIGHT series, a group of seven moral-boosting documentaries supervised by Lt. Col. Frank Capra. As brilliantly assembled as any of Capra's ""populist"" Hollywood films, PRELUDE demonstrates how the diplomatic and political blunders made in the wake of WWI led inexorably to World War II. Especially culpable are those complacent citizens of the USA who were led to believe that the problems of the rest of the world had no bearing on their lives. While America sleeps, Japan and Germany slowly and methodically build their armies and launch their plans for global conquest. Throughout the film, the lies of fascisim and totalitarinism are contrasted with the ideals of Democracy. Unlike most other War Department efforts, the 53 minute WHY WE FIGHT was shown to both civilian military audiences. U.S. shipping and handling is $3.00. International shipping is $4.50.

Certainly the booze-oriented, birds-obsessed antics of Martin Clunes' Gary and Neil Morrissey's Tony have become every bit as connected to Britain's collective funny bone as Basil Fawlty's inept hostelry or Ernie Wise's short, hairy legs. Yet, the series could easily have been cancelled when ITV viewers failed to respond to the original version, which featured Clunes sharing his flat with someone named Dermot, played by Harry Enfield. Indeed, it was only when the third series moved to the BBC and was then broadcast in a post-watershed slot--allowing writer Simon Nye greater freedom to explore his characters' saucier ruminations--that the show began to gain a significant audience. By then, of course, Morrissey had become firmly ensconced on the collective pizza-stained sofa, while more screen time was allocated to the boys' respective foils, Caroline Quentin and Leslie Ash. Often glibly dismissed as a lame-brained succession of gags about sex and flatulence, the later series not only featured great performances and sharp-as-nails writing but also sported a contemporary attitude that dared to go where angels, and certainly most other sitcoms, feared to tread. Or, as Gary was once moved to comment about soft-porn lesbian epic Love in a Women's Prison: ""It's a serious study of repressed sexuality in a pressure-cooker environment."" Series 3 includes: ""Lovers"" in which Gary becomes worried that he hasn't slept with enough women; ""Bed"" in which Dorothy and Gary experience problems in the boudoir (""What's the matter? We always have sex after I've cooked for us. That's why I do it.""); ""Casual Ties"" in which a depressed Deborah decides to sell her flat and go travelling, while Tony fails to cheer her up by impersonating different types of Cheese; ""Weekend"" in which Tony gets a job at The Crown; ""Cleaning Lady"" in which Tony reconsiders his professional options (""I could be an escort."" ""What, a car?"" asks Gary); ""Marriage"" in which Gary joins Dorothy for a candlelit dinner (""Why she couldn't find a restaurant with proper lighting I don't know""). Duration: 174 mins The video is in excellent condition and comes in a plastic case with all original artwork and description. It is in US video format, playable on US VCRs. The charge for shipping in the US is $3.00, via USPS with delivery confirmation. Thank You. Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Billpoint, Money Order, Personal Check.
