As the film opens, only her mother believes Fanny can make it in show business. When she gets her first break at Keeney's Music Hall, her hilarious debut as a rollerskating chorus girl gets her hired as a comedienne. A year later Fanny is working for Florenz Ziegfeld in his famous Follies and brings the house down with an outrageous and unplanned number. Fanny becomes a star, falls in love and marries Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), a handsome gambler whose luck doesn't hold up.

Whether you are a beginning or advanced guitarist, you will benefit from Fred Hand's in-depth explorationof the fundamental principles of classical guitar technique. ""Your body and mind have an innate ability to express the music that you hear,"" says Hand, ""you only need to tap into this source."" By learning the essentials of good playing, such as posture, relaxation, fingernail shaping and the correct application of the free stroke and rest stroke, you will quickly become a smoother and more efficient player. As you practice your arpeggios, scales, vibrato, trills and cross-string trills, you'll learn to apply them to beautiful classical-style pieces such as John Dowland's ""Lady Hunnsden's Puffe"" and a dance by Gaspar Sanz. Hand's own compositions, ""A Celtic Tale,"" ""Heartsong "" and ""Lesley's Song"" are perfect examples of the application of classical techniques to pieces in a contemporary setting. This is a lesson that will dramatically improve the playing of both classical musicians and fingerstyle guitarists of other tradition. About Frederic Frederick Hand's 30-year recording, composing and touring career has garnered rave reviews from critics throughout the world. He has performed with Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Zubin Mehta, Pierre Boulez, The Waverly Consort, Mostly Mozart Orchestra and his own ensemble, Jazzantiqua. He arranged and performed the theme from Academy Award-winning film ""Kramer Vs. Kramer,"" which led to best-selling recordings ""Baroque and On The Street"" (Sony) and ""Jazzantiqua"" (Musicmasters/BMG). Mr. Hand is currently on the faculty of Mannes College of Music and has given masterclasses at the New England Conservatory, Boston Conservatory, Yale University and Emory University. His compositions are published and recorded around the world. He is the 1996 Emmy-award winning composer for ""The Guiding Light."" The New York Times wrote, ""He played unerringly, with all the verve and spirit that one could ask,"" while the Milwaulkee Sentinel called Hand ""A brilliant master of the guitar."" 75 Minute VHS Video, In Gently Used Condition.

DVD After the stiff attempts at realism in many recent features, it's a treat to see broad cartoon-style animation on the big screen in Osmosis Jones, a spoof of cop movies set inside the human body. The title character (voice by Chris Rock) is a street-smart white blood cell, working for Frank's immune system. He and Drix (David Hyde Pierce), an over-the-counter cold capsule, are reluctant partners fighting what appears to be a minor infection. Osmosis discovers Frank has really contracted a fatal virus, Thrax (Laurence Fishburne): he battles a corrupt body politic led by a venal mayor (William Shatner) to save Frank's life and win the affection of the mayor's aide, Leah (Brandy Norwood). Rock's motor-mouth delivery can get annoying, but it contrasts nicely with straight arrow Drix (imagine a fussy Buzz Lightyear). Excellent drawing and a powerful vocal performance make Thrax a genuinely frightening villain.

Never Viewed! Call of the Wild, Jack London's classic story of a young man's adventure in the Yukon, is transformed into a breathtaking, action packed film starring Lonesome Dove's Rick Schroder and Mia Sara (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Shot on location in the rustic wilderness of British Columbia, it's an exciting film the whole family will enjoy. It's 1897 and young John Thorton feels the need to break free from his father's overbearing grip. John jumps a steamer north to join the frenzied fever of the Yukon Gold Rush. But ""the call of the wild"" is not the place pictured in his romantic dreams. Harsh weather, unforgiving terrain, hostile Indians and cutthroat miners remind him he is far from home. John Thorton is struggling for survival, but he has three good reasons to stay alive: Charlie, a wise Indian who becomes his friend and teacher, Sue, the first true love of his life, and Buck the courageous dog who helps show him the true meaning of life. Together they will share joy and sorrow in an unforgetable adventure of discovery. A real classic. DVD DETAILS: Rated G; 97 minutes; Color; Coded Region 1 (US and Canada).

POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE US ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 27x40 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for BIG LEBOWSKI posters sell for about $100 each (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint. Those are photocopies of the originals and the quality is not nearly as good. I offer a complete satisfaction guarantee on all my products!!!

This tape comes from my personal collection and has only been watched a couple of times. Both box and tape are in near excellent condition. The wild imaginations of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez team up for an over-the-top blast combination of vampires and gangsters that has become a cult legend. Tarantino and George Clooney are convict brothers on the run who take Harvey Keitel and his family, including daughter Juliette Lewis hostage. They go to a Mexican truck stop for a meet that turns into a nightmare when it turns out that the employees of the bar are all a bunch of vampires. Soon, there's only a handful of humans left. The action and gore are nearly nonstop, and the film plays much better in the widescreen mode. Look for Salma Hayek as a sexy vampire, along with Fred Hammer Williamson, special effects whiz Tom Savini and Cheech Marin (playing three different characters) in supporting roles.

Short-running (48 minutes) mystery marked the film debut of Raymond Massey, who portrayed the legendary sleuth Sherlock Holmes. That's Massey at center in the JPG. Forgive the poor scan -- actual photo is much better. Massey is not shown in the other 2 photos. All 3 of the 8 X 10 original photos show edge and corner wear, a pinhole or two here and there and some other problems, but nothing detracts too much. Editor's crayon code in upper left of each photo can be easily and completely removed by using a soft, NON-MOIST tissue. Overall condition merits good-minus, considering age and handling. An attractive lot perhaps for the more advanced film collector, taking into account it was Massey's first film. Come sleeved and with backing board. Buyer to pay $3.50 for secure first-class shipping. Please see my other top-quality and interesting old movie photos, other photos, books, paper collectibles and memorabilia now on sale.

There is no conventional dialogue to progress the narrative. Our story is about Pink, a rock and roll performer, who sits locked in a hotel room, somewhere in Los Angeles. Too many shows, too much dope, too much applause: a burned out case. On the TV, an all-too-familiar war film flickers on the screen. We shuffle time and place, reality and nightmare, as we venture into Pink's painful memories, each one a 'brick' in the wall he has gradually built around his feelings. Slowly he withdraws from the real world and slips further into his nightmare as he imagines himself as an unfeeling demagogue, for whom all that is left is the demonstration of power over his unthinking audience, the culmination of the odious excess of his own world and the world around him. His internal self trial follows, as the witnesses of his past life, the very people who have contributed to the building of the wall, come forward and testify against him. --Alan Parker Pink Floyd The Wall: Deluxe DVD Edition features: New Hi-Definition film transfer from the original widescreen interpositive. Previously unreleased footage. Remastered 5.1 Dolby Digital and Surround Encoded PCM Stereo Soundtracks from the original master tapes. The Other Side Of The Wall: A 25-minute documentary about the making of the film. Running commentary from Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe.

Just in time for Christmas_here are several neat movie-related items from M_xico! They will make someone very happy Christmas morning! Happy Holidays, and God bless. Take a look at our new website! Link below! Mexican lobby cards are larger (12.50 x 16.75) and often more colorful and action-packed than other lobbies. They usually come in a set of eight, with brightly colored artwork and a black and white inset photo which varies from card to card. These are actual, theater used posters. They come from a collector friend whose mother-in-law worked for a film distributor in M_xico City. She saved the ones she liked, and stored them carefully. They are a historical treasure today! Here's a wonderful Jane Powell item! It's a mini poster from Mexico, probably meant to be a calendar top, with Jane all dalmationed out. A good size 11.74 x 14.5 inches. Sweet and a bit campy--Jane looks great! Take a look at all my auctions--where else but at Mexican Memorabilia can you consistently find such a high percentage of unusual, quality collectibles you never see anywhere else? If you have trouble seeing my photos, please drop me a line and I will e- them out to you. CONDITION: Very light wear, two small tack holes!_See Photo!

Remember, now you can use your credit card to pay with BidPay! Just click on their banner below. Please check out the other great auctions I currently have running on eBay.

Lobby cards, movie-related displays and promotions? Advertisements? We've got all kinds of stuff, from the teens to the 60's. Speaking of all kinds of stuff--if you haven_t been to Bruce Hershenson_s, you are really missing out!

You are bidding on a BRAND NEW(factory sealed) VHS video of JAZZ SCENE 1962 USA's broadcast of STAN KENTON and FRANK ROSOLINO. This nationally syndicated television program, the brainchild of life-long jazz devotee Steve Allen, was a series which showcases many jazz performers. Uncompromising in its use of imaginative camera angles, the visual style is on par with the creativity of the music. These shows are time capsules to treasure from America's golden age of television. FRANK ROSOLINO (1926-1978) was quite simply one of the most brilliant trombone stylists in jazz history. His exceptional technique and exuberant personality sent bolts of intensity through every solo. After extensive experience in the big bands of Bob Chester, Glen Gray, Gene Krupa, with whom he recorded and filmed the delightful Lemon Drop, Tony Pastor, Herbie Fields and Stan Kenton, plus the wonderful 1951 Georgie Auld Quartet, he settled in Los Angeles in 1954. It wasn't long before ROSOLINO was trombonist numero uno on the West Coast, working regularly with the Lighthouse All Stars, and frequently getting calls for record, film and TV studio work. His rhythm section on this broadcast included a young Mike Melvoin on piano, bassist Bob Bertaux, and drummer Nick Martinis. The set consists mostly of standards: Yesterdays (at an unusually fast tempo) Mean To Me Please Don't Bug Me Lover Man and Thelonious Monk's Well You Needn't The stature of STAN KENTON (1912-1979) in the pantheon of big band jazz remains unchallenged to this day, more than fifty years after he made his first waves in the early 1940's. Committed to music education and the nurturing of young talent, through his band's ranks passed many of modern jazz's most compelling performers, including Art Pepper, Stan Getz, Shelly Manne, Maynard Ferguson, Anita O'Day, June Christy, Lee Konitz, Frank Rosolino, Conte Condoli, and Mel Lewis, to name just a few. Kenton's controversial emphasis on composition in the jazz idiom encouraged the work of such writers as Pete Rugolo, Bill Russo, Gerry Mulligan and Shorty Rogers. Marvin Stamm is on trumpet, Don Menza on tenor, and Bob Fitzpatrick on trombone are featured here along with Kenton performing: Limehouse Blues All The Things You Are Waltz of the Prophets Maria Malaguena The video is 60 minutes in length, recorded in SP Mode/RealTime. Winning bidder (Other than the ""BUY IT NOW"" winner) to pay an additional $2.50 for Media Mail, $3.50 for First Class Mail OR $4.50 for Priority Mail in the US. Optional insurance is available @ $1.10 per item. Also, with the holiday season upon us, we will gift wrap and send your package to a third person as a gift. Fees apply. Foreign rates apply per country of destination. Paypal is gladly accepted! Please see our feedback and bid with confidence.

Cohan & MORE! I came into a huge collection of THE THEATRE magazines this weekend - circa 1900 to 1918. A lot of them have great articles, great pics of the great theatrical people of that time, and lots of wonderful ads - some black & white and some color. So from this wonderful collection of paper I am offering: A complete June 1914 issue of THE THEATRE. I can't even begin to tell you what you get inside but I will detail some of the highlights: A very nice FRAMEABLE cover (light carboard) of MISS LAURETTE TAYLOR in ""Peg O' My Heart""; a back cover (light cardboard) color page for PACKARD; black and white ads for Lord & Taylor (""Onyx Hosiery""); Columbia Graphophone Co (endorsed by Vernon Castle); Good Year; Wilcox & White Co Pianos; Victrola; Burgesser Hats; Lucky Strike Cigarettes; Speedway Runabout; BVD; Riz La Famous Cigarette Papers; Egyptian Deities Cigarettes; Violet Sec Toilet Water. Color ad (inside back cover) for MURAD Cigarettes. B&W pictures/articles of Ethel Barrymore, Marie Nordstrom, Marie Wallace, Flo Hart, Bessie Gross, Lydia Lopokova, Inez Plummer, Margaret Anglin, Cecil Kern, Eva Davenport, Grace George, Lois Meredith, Ann Swinburne, Grace Valentine, Lawrence Dorsay, Robert Mantell, Vivian Rushmore, Julia Marlow, Frances Starr, Vera Finley. Articles include WHAT THE AMERICAN FLAG HAS DONE FOR ME by George M. Cohan, BILLIE BURKE in Her Home, WHAT IS A JEUVENILE LEAD? by JOHN BARRYMORE. The cover is frameable - nicks at the edges, a few small cuts at the edges, wear on the spine but for something almost 100 years old, I think you will forgive the small stuff! What you see is what you get - I used the digital camera to take the pics cause my scanner wouldn't take in the whole print. The pages of the magazine measure 10"" x 14"". GORGEOUS SUBDUED COLOR! (look for other fabulous paper I have up in other categories!) NO RESERVE AFTER OPENING BID!! Winning bidder to pay for priority shipping (the reason for this is the cardboard the USPO provides makes sure that you get this item in perfect condition as it as so large). Insurance is at your discretion. I love money orders (asap shipping) and PAYPAL (asap shipping) but I will take a personal check with a 10-day hold on the goods while the check clears. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at wimsey@mediaone.net. Thanks and GOOD LUCK! Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Money Order, Personal Check.

If you lived in the New York City area in the 1950's and 60's you certainly should! Tex was the weatherman on NBC Channel 4, sponsored by Con Edison (Consolidated Edison Power & Light), and Uncle Wethbee was his ""magnetic"" cartoon sidekick. Unk's large bald head was on a large board, and Tex would add magnetized hair, mustaches, hats, scarves, etc., depending on the forecast (Did you know that each of Unk's garments or hairstyles had a different weather meaning? - Find out what they were in this great little booklet). This booklet measures 5 1/2"" x 8 1/4"" and has 30 pages (including covers) chock full of information about weather, monthly weather almanac, Con Edison ads, a picture of the late Tex and facsimile signature. Tex was famous, or infamous, for showing up on the air three sheets to the wind, and was once suspended for adivising women rape victims to ""lie back and enjoy it."" He also went through an on-air crying jag one New Year's Eve, when his estranged spouse (an actress) appeared in a commercial which was aired during his broadcast (""...That was my wife...).

In their small London flat, Dalmatians Pongo and Perdy, and their human ""pets"" Roger and Anita, are overjoyed by the arrival of 15 puppies. But when the spotted-fur-loving Ms. De Vil and her clumsy cohorts, Jasper and Horace, dognap the litter - along with every other Dalmatian pup in London - Pongo and Perdy must rally the town's animals to their rescue. The plan hurls them towards a thrilling climax filled with uproarious moments as the puppies attempt to outwit their captors and bring on a final showdown with Cruella! 102 Dalmations Cruella De Vil has been conditioned like Pavlov's dogs to resist her passion for pups, but is she really reformed? When it all comes undone, she's doggoned determined to gather 101 Dalmatians to make her black and white coat. Make that 102 Dalmatians: She's decided to add a hood!

Patricia Arquette stars as Kristen, whose nightmare leads to a slashed wrist which looks suspiciously like a suicide attempt. She is placed in a hospital psychiatric ward with a group of six other troubled teens, who all dream about the same horribly burned man, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) trying to kill them. Perhaps the most unusual thing about this picture, however, is the unexpected depth of sadness running through it. There are some achingly sweet moments in this otherwise frightening film which, though not disruptive, are impossible to analyze. The first and most bizarre of these is the entrance of dream researcher Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), which inexplicably causes most viewers to get misty-eyed, and there are several similar scenes throughout the film. One answer can be found in the sensitive direction of Chuck Russell, who emphasizes the tragedy and utter hopelessness in these kids' lives and manages to wring some unexpectedly perceptive turns from his cast. This is a film in which a great deal of care was obviously lavished on individual scenes (the sets are outstanding) and performances. The results are well worth repeated viewings, and prove that sequels don't necessarily have to be inferior films. This video is previously viewed but from a private collection in its original box. The box has some wear but overall is in good condition. The tape is in excellent condition.

So we decided to meet, and are now working on figuring out where our relationship/friendship goes from here. One big problem. She lives in Alaska and he lives in Los Angeles. Long distance relationships can get expensive, with the phone bills if nothing else, so we decided to sell together on e-Bay to help defray the costs. Are we telling you this to appeal to your sappy sense of sentimentality so you'll bid higher? Absolutely! Good luck and happy bidding!! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

Directed by George Sydney. Based on Elvis Presley's decision to join the army at the height of his popularity, this 1963 film introduces rock 'n' roller Conrad Birdie (Jesse Pearson) just before he's off to boot camp. But first, he has to say goodbye to his adoring fans, especially to the beautiful Kim McAfee (Ann-Margaret), who runs a fan club nearby. Suddenly all the kids in town are bucking authority and having far too much fun - which naturally makes the adults nervous. Bye Bye Birdie is a wild romp about the birth of rock and roll and all the change it brought with it. Ann-Margaret's songs are sexy enough to compete with anything Madonna's done on film, while Dick Van Dyke's portrayal of a smooth-talkin' PR man is an eerie look at the direction show biz would take.

YOU ARE BIDDING ON THIS AWESOME MOVIE POSTER WHICH IS THE US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER AND IS IN MINT CONDITION, NEVER USED WITH SHARP EDGES AND CORNERS AND COMES PACKAGED ROLLED, WRAPPED IN PLASTIC FOR MOISTURE PROTECTION, CUSHIONED, WRAPPED AND SHIPPED IN A PROTECTIVE TUBE (WE HAVE OVER 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS SO BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!!). POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE US ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 27x40 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for A CLOCKWORK ORANGE posters sell for about $350 each (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint. Those are photocopies of the originals and the quality is not nearly as good. I offer a complete satisfaction guarantee on all my products!!!

Each of the Chapters stands alone as a story, but the five together weave a rich tapestry. This award-winning anime series is being reconsidered as a classic of the art form, and shows just how far the art of the animation technique can be stretched. The story spreads over the past, the future, and all points in between, yet maintains a consistent point of view.

Starring Lucille Ball, Beatrice Arthur, Bruce Davison, Joyce Van Patten, Kirby Furlong and Robert Preston. She throws parties for every occasion- or nonoccasion- that comes to mind. Circles the globe and files high on cardboard moons. Gallops to victory in a fox hunt the first time she ever mounts a horse. She's Mame Dennis, one of the most beloved stage and screen characters of the last 30 years. And Mame, the 1974 film edition of the 1966 Broadway musical smash, is the latest- and most glittering- appearance of the madcap for whom "" life is a banquet. "" Playing Mame is another well-loved lady. In her final theatrical film, the late Lucille Ball invested Mame with the glamour that inspired photography experts to dub her "" Technicolor Tessie "" for her alluring blues eyes and gorgeous, open face. A former Goldwyn Girl from early movie musicals, Lucy's right in step with a high-kicking chorus and right on target with punchliness and pratfalls. On hand from New York original are TV Golden Girl Beatrice Arthur, delightfully reprising her Tony Award-winning role as venomously vampy Vera Charles; Jane Connell as the ever-befuddled governess Agnes Gooch; and two of Broadway's best magic-makers: chorographer Onna White and the three-time Tony-winning director Gene Saks. Joining the club as Mame's husband Beauregard, The Music Man's Robert Preston sings the liting "" Loving You, "" written especially for the film by Jerry Herman ( Hello, Dolly! La Cage aux Folles ). His tunes for Mame, from the uptempo "" It's Today "" and "" We Need a Little Christmas "" to pensive "" My Best Girl "" and "" If He Walked into My Life, "" rank among Broadway's best. So light the candles, get the ice out, roll the rug up. And be sure to invite Mame. We do NOT participate in any credit card or pay through programs.

Set in the American South, a small town. From the play Valentine's Day by Horton Foote . A prequel to Horton Foote's 1918 (released in 1985) On Valentine's Day was filmed in 1984, then held back from release till 1986. On the titular day, Elizabeth Vaughn ( Hallie Foote, Horton's daughter) and Horace Robedeaux ( William Converse-Roberts ) elope. Horace stubbornly refuses to ask for financial assistance from his parents or in-laws, so the penniless couple is compelled to live in an inexpensive boarding house. Their fellow tenants are the usual assortment of eccentrics, including alcoholic Bobby Pate ( Richard Jenkins ), spinster Miss Ruth ( Carol Goodheart ), heartbroken George Tyler ( Steven Hill ) and garrulous young Bessie ( Jeanne McCarthy ). After several months of enduring the woes of the other boarders, Horace swallows his pride and agrees to allow father-in-law Michael Higgins to support him and Elizabeth . There's a reconciliation, but one tinged with the premonition that Horace and Elizabeth aren't out of the woods yet. Together with Portrait of a Marriage (never released theatrically), On Valentine's Day and 1918 were later reedited and incorporated into a Horton Foote TV trilogy on the PBS network. Director Ken Harrison . Starring: William Converse-Roberts, Hallie Foote, Michael Higgins, Steven Hill, Richard Jenkins, Carol Goodheart, Jeanne McCarthy, Matthew Broderick .

He meets Wesley Pendergrass (Christopher Walken), the smooth-talking hood who tries to talk Johnny into helping in the heist of a jewelry store. Johnny considers the offer but elects to enter the ring to help Ruby (Debra Feuer) and her financially troubled arcade with the prize money. He agrees to the bout despite the fact that a blow to his fractured temple bone could kill him. Plodding, pretentious, and cliche-ridden, Walken's performance is the highlight of this grim film. Roarke sued to stop the release of the feature, claiming that the money and creative control promised to him was never delivered.

Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Description BARBARELLA THE AWESOME JAPANESE ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER OF THE CLASSIC JANE FONDA MOVIE! YOU ARE BIDDING ON THIS AWESOME MOVIE POSTER WHICH IS THE JAPANESE ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER AND IS IN MINT CONDITION, NEVER USED WITH SHARP EDGES AND CORNERS AND COMES ROLLED, PROTECTIVELY WRAPPED IN PLASTIC, CUSHIONED AND SECURED AND SHIPPED IN A PROTECTIVE TUBE (WE HAVE OVER 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS SO BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!!). POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE JAPANESE ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 26x39 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for BARBARELLA posters sell for a few hundred dollars (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like BARBARELLA. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint. Those are photocopies of the originals and the quality is not nearly as good. I offer a complete satisfaction guarantee on all my products!!! SHIPPING INFORMATION: Products will ship within 1-2 business days of receipt of payment via USPS Priority Mail unless otherwise requested (additional charges may apply to special shipping requests).
