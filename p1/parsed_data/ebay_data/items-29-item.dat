Please visit our many other auctions BID WITH CONFIDENCE! 2,000+ Positive Feedbacks! If this is your first time bidding with us, please read our FAQ Page. If you cannot comply with the terms of the auction, please do not bid. FAQ HOW CAN YOU SELL SO CHEAP? WHERE DO YOU GET THE STUFF? We specialize in the remarketing of New, Used, and Distressed Merchandise. These items are from overstock warehouses, company liquidations, freight claims, bulk auctions, and insurance purchases. This means that some items may be missing manuals, cords, cables, disks, factory packaging and/or may have light to severe damage. Please read the ENTIRE auction and ask ALL questions prior to bidding. We suggest you call or visit the manufacturer's page for detailed information. Items may have come originally with accessories such as remotes, cables, or batteries. If it's not listed in the description, don't expect it. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ""UNTESTED"" AND ""AS-IS""? Please understand that our warehouse does not have the equipment, facilities, or time to fully test every item. We offer a ""cursory"" inspection on all items and list our findings in the auction description. We supply all available Make/Model information for you to review and research. Please do your own research prior to bidding. All items and contents are described to the best of our ability. Unless the auction description states differently, these items are sold and ""as-is"". We reserve the right to refuse sale or service for any reason. WHEN SHOULD I SEND PAYMENT? Payment is due within 10 days of the closing of the auction. Otherwise, we reserve the right to re-post or re-sell this item and request credit from eBay, at our discretion. Acceptable forms of payment include Cashier Checks, Money Orders, and Bank Wire Transfers. If necessary, we can accept personal or company checks. We normally ship within 3-5 business days for certified funds. We hold all checks for 7-10 working days for validation. We do not use I-Escrow or any other escrow company. Other payment terms may be available and will be disclosed in our ""Payment Email"" that will be sent to you at the end of the auction. Unless otherwise stated, Sales are final. All others we offer a 50% restocking fee for any returns, less shipping and paypal fees (if applicable). I WON MORE THAN ONE ITEM OR I AM BIDDING ON MORE OF YOUR AUCTIONS. SHOULD I WAIT AND SEND PAYMENTS ALL AT ONCE? I MAY SAVE A BUCK OR TWO? Although we appreciate you bidding on more of our items, it would be more efficient if you sent in each payment as the item closes. We use an automated system and it sends out confirmations, feedbacks, Non-Pay Bidder Reminders, and other eBay related operations automatically. That's why it's so important to get payment in within 10 days of the close of the auction and keep auctions as separate transactions. If you delay, you may get warnings from eBay or you may actually lose your item because it got re-posted. We also do not combine shipping fees because we ship from various warehouses and cannot guarantee that items will be shipped together. Also, it requires us to manually do each multiple order and that interferes with our automated system. Therfore, we do not combine shipping fees. If you get multiple items shipped together, it's just a matter of luck and chance. HOW DO YOU SHIP WITH AND WHAT IF I'M OUTSIDE YOUR STANDARD SHIPPING AREA? We ship via UPS Ground from Connecticut, 06804. For books, videos, CDs video games and other media we may offer Media Mail Rates. If available, it would be listed in the auction description. We cannot ship to PO BOXES or Military APO addresses. If you are outside the 48 contiguous US states, shipping fees are more. Please contact us for the estimated rates prior to bidding. PAYPAL USERS: We can ONLY ship to verified Paypal addresses. If you want it shipped to a different address send your payment via the mail. Whenever possible, we will provide shipping weights and/or fixed shipping costs. Fixed shipping rates are for shipping within the 48 contiguous states. If you are outside of this area, contact us prior to bidding. Shipping will be higher. Sorry, we do not combine shipping fees. It screws up our automated accounting and shipping programs. HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN YOU RECEIVE MY PAYMENT OR WHEN MY ITEM IS SHIPPED? We issue the buyer a Positive Feedback the day your payment is received and entered. You can use this as a reference of when your item will be shipped. If you provide us an email, we will email you a tracking number. All shipping questions should be directed to shipping@highendequipment.com. We are no longer responsible for items once it is picked up by the courier. If damage occurs during transit, we will assist in the claims process. No product refunds will be issued until the claim is paid. Shipping fees are not refundable for any reason. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I BID? Please read all the information on the auction and do your research prior to bidding. If you have any questions, please call our office at 203-740-9111 or email us at inquiry@highendequipment.com. By placing a bid on this auction you are confirming that you have read all the information, asked all your questions, and understand the terms of this auction. NICE FEEDBACK RATING, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY NEGATIVES? The fact of the matter is, we are only human. We do make mistakes. We also use automated systems and internet based platforms to help automate the selling process. We can fix our human errors, unfortunately the others are not as easy. We can't fix external programs like eBay or AuctionWatch. Most problems can be resolved with one phone call. We try our best to service all customers and when we make a mistake, we take care of it. Not every buyer gives us the opportunity to correct for our mistakes. Most of our negatives are from new users who don't understand or respect the rules of eBay. They don't read the auctions and are not very good shoppers. If a problem comes up, they SLAM a Negative Feedback and not even give us a chance to address the issue. Basically, when we are given the opportunity, we take care of everybody. Hey, you can't be an eBay PowerSeller without doing something right! MAN, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS RETURN EMAILS FASTER? Everyone in our company travels frequently to find the best deals to bring to you on eBay. Therefore, it is difficult for us to return emails in a timely manner. If all else fails, call our office for assistance. 203-740-9111. Office hours are Mon-Fri 9am-5pm EST. We strive to bring you the best items at the very best prices possible!

They are soft and shiny black, not dull as pics show. I bought this last month on ebay and never wore them because they are big for me, even with socks, my heels slide off the clogs (which have a short heel support which is very nice). Description says 7 1/2, it might be a little bigger than that as I wear 7 to 7 1/2. I just want to get some money back. Here is the seller's description, which is very accurate - except the box says USA 8M (8 was crossed and 7 1/2 was penned in), UK 5 1/2 M. EUR 39M. What I have for you is a brand new, never before used pair of 2001 Tommy Hilfiger clogs size 7 1/2M. Guaranteed authentic and brand new still in the box, with tissue and all! Ever in a hurry? These black clogs are great and a must for the person on the go. They are made of genuine buttery soft leather. The inside is cushioned so these clogs are extremely comfortable! The sole of these shoes are skid resistant, awesome! They will go great with your dresses, jeans or slacks. These clogs can be used for shopping or anywhere you plan to do alot of walking. They are definitely an eye catcher. I guarantee your friends will adore them and so will you. I purchased them last month while on vacation and never wore them. Enough of me raving about them, you be the judge, look at the pictures. They can be yours today for a fraction of the price. These clogs were purchased at Carson Pirie Scott in downtown Chicago for much more. At these prices you can have shoes in every color for every outfit. I took several pics so you can see how nice these are - wish they really fit me! Good luck and thank you for looking! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Visit Wigs of Juvilee today!

This chemise (short slip that the French love) is oooooh so feminine. It's got it all--right from the shimmer and gloss to the lace to the satiny feel to the sexy little spaghetti straps -- and more flowers than a bloomin' garden! And it's a small - for that delicate charming one who will finally own this! Today's small is about a 33/34 bust. You know that Victoria's Secret really knows how to enhance you--so beguiling. And look at this leg area treatment (both sides) with the lace that matches above bodice lace.... ....and what was I saying about a blooming garden. As the English say, you'll be ""a bit of all right"" wearing this one... Colors are pink, raspberry, teal, Persian blue, wine, vanilla cream, white (the lace)rainbow gold--and all with an icy frost look to fabric but meant for a ""warm"" gurl. This chemise/slip can be worn under something so you'll feel sexy all day or wear it as a fetching number to sleep in. Personally, I'd be standing too long in front of the mirror if I owned it. You just have to admire yourself and your good taste when you obtain such a beauty. Remember, only one of you gets this. It's new but without tags and has been kept smoke-free, as all my things are. I shop the small and large towns of Southern California to find things I love and hope you will too. I just can't pass by anything floral without it going in my basket. S/H $3.50 Priority Mail. I accept money orders, cashier checks, and PayPal (Visa/MasterCard through PayPal only)--and I will accept personal checks if you have excellent feedback. Don't hesitate to email with questions important to you. I don't always re-list my items, but when I do, I have to increase the cost for my time--so bid early and this time around to save money. This would be so much more at the boutiques. If not for you, great for gift giving and there's still time for the holidays."

Check out this great Victoria's Secret white cotton sports bra with mesh insets. Cool cotton/spandex molded cups with mesh inset in middle. Back and straps are all cool, stretchable mesh. It has the Victoria's Secret label inside but because it is dead stock, the size label is missing. Mannequin is Size 34 and it is big on her so it seems to be a size 36-B. Closes in back with three sets of hooks and eyes. This is new and has never been worn. The only flaw is a tiny blue shadow mark on right front which is barely noticeable (possibly from storing it near a blue slip) and would probably come out in wash cycle. In like-new condition otherwise. Victoria's Secret at a low, low price. This bra will provide great support for your workouts or sports.

Note: As a seller it's sometimes hard to determine the exact shipping price on an item. Sometimes it might cost less then what I anticipate, and sometimes more. If it costs more, I pay the difference, but then again, if it costs a little less, I do not make refunds. I think that's fair. I charge only $2.50 for shipping because I ship First Class in a yellow envelope. The item is wrapped in tissue paper, then placed in a large zip lock bag so that in case it rains it will hopefully not get wet. I haven't had any problems so far, but I will ship priority if you desire. The price for shipping (and handling) priority is $4.00 on one item (more for multiple). I am also not responsible for lost or damaged items. If you are the high bidder and you'd like your item insured, please advise me before payment is submitted.

The tag says it's a size 3T, but it fit my girl like a 2T. No rips, stains or holes. But I had to bleach the collar to clean it and so it's white with blue stitching instead of baby blue in color. Looks totally natural though~ can't tell that it used to be baby blue in color. The front has one embroidered Tommy logo star on it with a baby blue and a silver star embroidered on each side of that. My favorite part is the the edges are kind of ruffly, they call it lettuce edging, makes it look really cute around the bottom and the sleeves. It also has baby blue around the bottom and the sleeves. The left sleeve also has an embroidered red, white and blue logo star on it. The back snaps up 3 times down from the nape for easy on and off the head. Cute top! Made of 100% cotton.

They all come from a fabulous non smokers home. This auction is for an Authentic Vintage Hermes belt. I do not know the style or the date of this belt. However, the two Hermes bags (from the same client) I just sold are from the 1960's, therefore I am assuming this is from then as well. The belt is a wonderful dark green and is in very good condition. ( Another Hermes belt I have from this client came with an OLD price and size tag from Bonwit Teller. The original price - back in the 60's? - was $60 and it says it is a 28 INS size.) I did some rough measurements as well: it measures a hefty 2 inches wide and 32 inches long from tip to tip, although the belt is curved for a nice fit. I also tried to measure from the ""loosest"" hole to the clasp and it seemed to measure approx 31 inches, but it is very hard to tell since it's curved. It does have 6 holes for adjustability and the clasp is a kind of C shaped hook. Inside the belt there is a loop to tuck the end into when it's on. This belt does appear to have some very slight cracks in the green leather at the edges - possibly it is a bit dry? They are only barely noticible - they do not detract at all. Inside it is marked in various places - by the hook: Made in France; and in the center: Bonwit Teller Hermes Paris. I could not find a marking on the clasp. The belt comes in its original Hermes orange box. The box measures approx 7"" x 7"" x 2 1/2"". Overall it is in very good condition with only minor wear on the corners. Also someone wrote ""green"" inside the lid in pen. There is no dust bag for this item. This is an absolutly fabulous find, a true vintage Hermes in such mint condition. It looks as if was hardly ever used. This is a lovely belt in exellent condition - you basically couldn't ask from more from a vintage Hermes belt! As this is such a rare find I have put a reserve on it to protect my client(but it not much more than the original price!). If you would like more info or photos please email me and I'll do what I can. Don't forget the holidays are getting closer - this would make an unforgettable gift!!! High bidder will pay all costs of packing, shipping and insurance. All money must be in US currency. Personal (& business) checks will be held at least two weeks before the item is shipped (no exceptions!). Send a money order or cashier's check for faster shipping!! I will also accept Biday and Paypal for this auction. Payment must be received within 10 days of the end of the auction or risk losing the right to buy and negative feedback.

If you are outside the USA, please contact me before bidding. _ ****See my other Auction items**** This applies to items shipped First Class Only!! Note: As a seller it's sometimes hard to determine the exact shipping price on an item. Sometimes it might cost less then what I anticipate, and sometimes more. If it costs more, I pay the difference, but then again, if it costs a little less, I do not make refunds. I think that's fair. I charge only $2.50 for shipping because I ship First Class in a yellow envelope. The item is wrapped in tissue paper, then placed in a large zip lock bag so that in case it rains it will hopefully not get wet. I haven't had any problems so far, but I will ship priority if you desire. The price for shipping (and handling) priority is $4.00 on one item (more for multiple). I am also not responsible for lost or damaged items. If you are the high bidder and you'd like your item insured, please advise me before payment is submitted.

HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas. If you want to use this service have your payment in by noon CST or call me at 847-924-8744 and I will let you know if I will be able to get the item out that day.

One is black and the other is a greenish color (see picture). They are both from Take Nine Maternity. The black one is Small while the green one is Medium. I was pregnant with twins when I wore these dresses. I am normally a size medium and got quite big while pregnant. They both fit me pretty much the same despite the size difference on the labels. Green dress: 73% Rayon 27% Polyester. Black dress: 70% Rayon 30% Polyester. Both dresses have three cream colored roses on the bodice. The dresses have a crepe like look to them. They say dry clean only but I guarantee that I didn't dry clean them. I just threw them in the wash with cold water. I believe I even put them in the dryer. They do need ironing if you hang them to dry. They are very comfortable and fairly long. I am 5' 7"" and they came down to just above my ankles.
